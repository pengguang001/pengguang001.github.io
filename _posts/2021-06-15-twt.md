TWT response里的Implicit bit决定是Implicit还是Explicit

Explicit TWT: 使用帧交换来协商下一次TWT信息，因而可能是非周期性的(aperiodic)

Implicit TWT: 下一次TWT是由当前TWT加上一个固定值，因而是周期性的

TWT response里的Flow type决定：

Announced TWT: flow type = 0, responding sta只有收到trigger (ps-poll或者apsd trigger)才会发送报文

Unannounced TWT: flow type = 1, responding sta不需要等待trigger，TWT sp到了就会发送报文

TBTT negotiation

TBTT scheduled STA可能发送TWT request给AP来协商在什么时刻起来收听beacon。request和response里：

  - Negotiation type = 1, TWT setup command = suggest/demand TWT（response为Accept)
  - 第一次起来的tbtt
  - wake interval
  - 请求的唤醒时间Nominal Minimum TWT Wake Duration

成功协商tbtt后，sta要按照约定在指定的tbtt醒过来听beacon

从代码看，nego type为1或3都会改变tbtt，但type为0不会


Individual TWT

In this example, STA 1 sends a TWT request to the TWT responding STA to setup a trigger-enabled TWT
agreement. The TWT responding STA accepts the TWT agreement with STA 1 and confirms the acceptance
in the TWT response sent to STA 1. Subsequently, the TWT responding STA sends an unsolicited TWT
response to STA 2 to setup a trigger-enabled TWT agreement with STA 2. Both these TWT agreements are
setup as announced TWTs. During the trigger-enabled TWT SP, the TWT responding STA sends a Basic
Trigger frame to which the TWT requesting STAs indicate that they are awake during the TWT SP. STA 1
indicates that it is awake by sending a PS-Poll frame and STA 2 indicates that it is awake by sending a QoS
Null frame in response to the Basic Trigger frame. STA 1 and STA 2 receive their DL BUs in a subsequent
exchange with the TWT responding STA and go to doze state outside of this TWT SP.


Broadcast TWT

The TWT scheduling AP includes a broadcast TWT element in the Beacon frame that indicates a broadcast
TWT SP during which the AP intends to send Trigger frames, or DL BUs to the TWT scheduled STAs. STA
1 and STA 2 wake to receive the Beacon frame to determine the broadcast TWT. During the trigger-enabled
TWT SP the AP sends a Basic Trigger frame to which STA 1 and STA 2 indicate that they are awake during
the TWT SP. STA 1 indicates that it is awake by sending a PS-Poll and STA 2 indicates that it is awake by
sending a QoS Null frame in response to the Basic Trigger frame. STA 1 and STA 2 receive their DL BUs in
a subsequent exchange with the AP and go to doze state outside of this TWT SP.
